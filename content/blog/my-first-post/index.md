hello, this is my first blog on my own website which i have created using hugo. ill be writing many more blogs about several topics related to computers and sometimes psychology. the rest of the times you might read about philosophy. I use nixos btw and i think i have come a long way in the journey that i have taken in the feild of technology, even though a lot of people call me dumb when i dont know how to solve a simple error message and realised the entire time i wasnt even plugged into my network for anything to work properly, yeah, we have all been there. life is a journey and so is tech, it takes us into diriections we dont expect and in reality we think we are moving forwards by making things which were tiedious and satisfying to do more easier, it makes us lathargic and sometimes even takes us backward instead of forwards.

what we do in this world at large is live a life that we dont know the purpose off and that gives us several paths that we arent aware of. we choose a path which most convienent, the same way, i think this website is a path in the right diriection to explore the most obscure self of my own, a mirror into what i call life, what i love and sometimes the futility of our very existence.

thank you for reading my first ever blog and dont worry if you liked it, because there will be more soon.
