The entire idea of self hosting your own services and managing them made me almost feel like a god. I didnt need to subscribe to any OTT platforms and drain my bank account in the process of watching Game of thrones. That aside i was able to further my knowledge in how services and networking actually worked. For the people who do self host content in you home, you must be aware of NAT, which prevents any outside traffic to enter you local network. When i first tried hosting a website on my old rusty dell laptop using a service called apache, i truly felt like a nerd!.\nit wasnt that easy, i soon came to realise that i cant access this website outside my own internet using mobile data or etc due to NAT. It took me a another year to discover that i can use VPN to access my internet using a mesh netowrk which the VPN provides. this is the VPN i use till date and it just works. TAILSCALE a key to all of my locked doors, this proved to be a more useful tool than expected, it gave its own IP and ran on a lower layer of my laptop\u0026rsquo;s processes and didnt pose any kind of inturruptions or exhausted my laptop\u0026rsquo;s resources. I later recommended this to my friend who goes by the nickname mindhunter. we were college students back when we discovered, we recently graduated and wanted to create a space for linux users and had converted a computer to a linux server which everyone could use with the help of tailscale.\nThe prospect of hosting a server and making it productive was truly a step in a diriection that i couldnt fathom, i had so many questions at that time and was facinated by how tailscale worked hence i write this as a thank you for tailscale, for truly being a key to all of my locked doors. We still use this server known as SVU, it is a community of diverse people who have found linux, learned linux and suffered with it.\n","date":"26 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nixos/a-key-to-all-doors/","section":"Nixos","summary":"","title":"A Key to All Doors","type":"nixos"},{"content":"","date":"26 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nixos/","section":"Nixos","summary":"","title":"Nixos","type":"nixos"},{"content":"","date":"26 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Blogs","type":"blog"},{"content":" hello, this is my first blog on my own website which i have created using hugo. ill be writing many more blogs about several topics related to computers and sometimes psychology. the rest of the times you might read about philosophy. I use nixos btw and i think i have come a long way in the journey that i have taken in the feild of technology, even though a lot of people call me dumb when i dont know how to solve a simple error message and realised the entire time i wasnt even plugged into my network for anything to work properly, yeah, we have all been there. life is a journey and so is tech, it takes us into diriections we dont expect and in reality we think we are moving forwards by making things which were tiedious and satisfying to do more easier, it makes us lathargic and sometimes even takes us backward instead of forwards.\nwhat we do in this world at large is live a life that we dont know the purpose off and that gives us several paths that we arent aware of. we choose a path which most convienent, the same way, i think this website is a path in the right diriection to explore the most obscure self of my own, a mirror into what i call life, what i love and sometimes the futility of our very existence.\nthank you for reading my first ever blog and dont worry if you liked it, because there will be more soon.\n","date":"26 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/my-first-post/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"My First Post","type":"blog"},{"content":"hello i am darshan.\n","date":"26 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/aboutme/","section":"Whoami","summary":"","title":"Whoami","type":"aboutme"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/videos/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"videos"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
